  Android device and emulator control from inside Dorka over adb, with the live
  device view in Dorka's emulator pane. Use when driving an adb-connected emulator
  or phone on Windows, Linux, or macOS: booting AVDs, taps, swipes, typing,
  hardware buttons, rotation, app install and launch, runtime permissions, the
  accessibility tree, and logcat. For an iOS simulator use the iOS emulator
  skill; build the APK with Gradle first.

# Dorka Emulator (Android)

`DORKA` is a placeholder for the executable you resolved in the stub; substitute it before running.

## Command surface

The Android backend shells out to the Android SDK (`adb`, `emulator`, `avdmanager`) that
Android Studio installs, so it runs on Windows, Linux, and macOS. Input uses
`adb shell input`, with no extra streaming server.

`DORKA emulator --help` lists the wrapped verbs. Anything else goes through
`DORKA emulator exec --command "<adb shell command>"`, which runs
`adb -s <serial> shell <command>` with the string unvalidated.

`install`, `launch`, `permissions`, and `logcat` are Android-only and fail against an iOS
device with `emulator_unsupported`. `tap`, `type`, `gesture`, `button`, `rotate`, `ax`, and
`exec` work on both backends, with backend-specific output for `ax` — a `uiautomator` node
tree on Android, a serve-sim node tree on iOS.

Camera and sensor injection are not wrapped; Android virtual-scene is out of scope. Device
control is local to the host that owns the SDK, so remote and SSH device control is out of
scope.

## Prerequisites

- Android Studio or the Android SDK installed, with `ANDROID_HOME` or `ANDROID_SDK_ROOT`
  set. Dorka also checks the per-OS default location (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Android\Sdk`,
  `~/Library/Android/sdk`, `~/Android/Sdk`).
- `adb` and `emulator` on the SDK path, plus at least one AVD (Android Studio ▸ Device
  Manager) or a connected device with USB debugging.
- A booted, adb-visible device before any input or capability command. A shutdown AVD is
  listed with `state: shutdown` and must be started first, by `DORKA emulator attach`,
  Android Studio, or `emulator @<avd>`.

Dorka returns a clear message when the SDK is missing
(`Android SDK not found. Install Android Studio and set ANDROID_HOME.`).

## Operations

Use `--json` for agent-driven calls. Unqualified commands target the worktree's active
device.

## Targeting

`attach`, or opening the emulator pane, makes one device active per worktree, and unqualified
commands target it. Pass a selector only to override that or reach a second device.

- `--device <serial>` such as `emulator-5554`, from `DORKA emulator devices`. An AVD name
  resolves only once that AVD is booted.
- `--emulator <id>` is an alternative spelling of `--device`: the bridge resolves both
  through the same device lookup.
- `--worktree id:<fullWorktreeId>` or `--worktree active`. The full id is the exact
  `<repo-id>::<path>` value returned by `DORKA worktree list --json`; a bare repo id is not
  valid here.
- `--worktree all` drops worktree scoping on every verb, not only on listing, so a mutating
  command passed `all` runs unscoped. Use it only for listing.
- `DORKA emulator devices` is global and lists every backend; the other verbs route to the
  backend that owns the resolved device.

## Constraints

- All coordinates are normalized 0..1 with a top-left origin, never pixels. Dorka scales them
  to the device's live resolution.
- Prefer `tap` over `gesture` for a single tap.
- `type` uses `adb shell input text`: US-ASCII only, spaces handled, newlines not. Use the
  app UI directly for unicode-heavy input.
- `gesture` is a straight swipe between the first and last point, so it fits scrolling and
  swiping but not a true multi-touch path.
- Run `kill` when you are done. A helper left running holds the device until Dorka quits.

## Examples

```text
DORKA emulator devices --json
DORKA emulator attach emulator-5554 --json
DORKA emulator tap 0.5 0.85 --json
DORKA emulator type "hello world" --json
DORKA emulator button recents --json
DORKA emulator install ./app-debug.apk --reinstall --json
DORKA emulator launch com.acme.app --json
DORKA emulator permissions grant com.acme.app android.permission.CAMERA --json
DORKA emulator ax --json
DORKA emulator logcat --lines 100 --json
DORKA emulator kill --json
```
