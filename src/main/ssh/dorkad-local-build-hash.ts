 * sha256 of `dorkad.js`, first 16 hex characters — or the activation gate would reject every
 * healthy candidate. Keeping the two in one comment is deliberate: they are one contract
 * split across a network, and the version string cannot stand in for it, because
 * `DORKA_VERSION` is whatever the launch command exported and two builds can carry one value.
